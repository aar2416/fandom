<h2> Zoom's Story</h2>
<p>Hunter Zolomon is a meta-human speedster from Earth Two. Following the explosion of S.T.A.R. Labs' particle accelerator,
 Hunter was affected during electroshock therapy by the dark matter emitted, giving him super speed. Following this,
 he escaped and became a supervillain known as Zoom, stylised as the Speed Demon. Later, using Velocity serums, Hunter
 managed to artificially increase his speed to the point where he could break the dimensional barrier. Having got tired
 of being the villain, Hunter decided to be "the hero" as Jay Garrick/The Flash, stylized as the Crimson Comet, borrowing
 the name from the speeder he found on another Earth and kept as prisoner. He created the charade in order to instill
 false hope - hope that would be ripped away.
 Discovering the existence of Barry Allen on Earth One, Hunter traveled to the other Earth and acted as his friend and
 mentor, apparently training him to fight Zoom, but instead forcing Barry to increase his speed to eventually take it
 for himself. Hunter eventually killed a time remnant of himself to give Barry a reason to avenge "Jay" and increase
 his speed even further, only for his true identity as Hunter Zolomon to be discovered by Team Flash soon after. Shortly
 after, intending to break Barry emotionally, he murders the latter's father Henry Allen, thus being indirectly
 responsible for Barry creating Flashpoint. After losing a race to Barry Allen and attempting to destroy the Multiverse,
 Time Wraiths appeared and imprisoned Hunter in the Speed Force.

 <h4>Early life</h4>
 When he was 11 years old, Hunter came downstairs to find his father abusing his mother, demanding respect following
 his service in the War of the Americas. Noticing Hunter, he took him in front of his mother, giving him his silver
 helmet, forcing him to watch as he murdered his mother. His father, James, was shortly sent to prison, causing Hunter
 to be sent to an orphanage as none of his relatives wanted to take him in. At some point in his life, Hunter claimed
 to have visited the city of Atlantis where one of his best friends originated and admired it as a place one wouldn’t
 ever want to leave
 <h4>Being on Earth One</h4>
 Hunter confirmed the existence of Earth One's Flash and spent the next six months piecing together clues and eventually
 learned his identity; Barry Allen, along with other details of his life. Knowing that Barry's Speed Force held the answer
 to curing himself, Hunter plotted to steal it. To expedite Barry's accumulation of Speed, he, as Zoom, began sending
 meta-human villains from Earth Two to Earth One to fight Barry, ensuring their co-operation by refusing to bring them
 back to Earth Two until they succeeded in killing him, though in reality Zoom had no intention of allowing Barry to die
 except by his hand. The first meta-human candidate was Al Rothstein/Atom-Smasher, who Zoom dragged to Earth One via one
 of the 52 breaches across Central City on Earth One, and promised him safe passage home in exchange for killing Flash
 which he agreed. Hunter also learned the names of Barry's then-current team members; Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon, Joe
 West, Iris West and Martin Stein. As Hunter watched Flash being honored at the "Flash Day" festival, he witnessed
 Atom-Smasher from his Earth attack Flash.

Following Atom-Smasher's defeat, Hunter arrived at S.T.A.R. Labs, bypassed their newly installed security, introduced
 himself, and claimed that their world was in danger.[6] Hunter introduced himself as "Jay Garrick" and explained to the
 skeptical team that the singularity had, in fact, opened a portal to his Earth through which other meta-humans had
 traveled, and that in his world he was a speedster named The Flash. Hunter also told them of his "enemy" Zoom and the
 circumstances of his arrival, but a skeptical Barry asked Jay to be tested to see if he really was a speedster. Hunter
 did so willingly, and explained his story of being a scientist to Caitlin, but Barry was still skeptical and had Hunter
 put in the pipeline prison. Hunter agreed to this, but tried to convince Barry that if Zoom had already sent Atom-Smasher,
 he would send others. Hunter also subjected himself to a full body scan upon Caitlin's request, and was tested on Barry's
 treadmill. However, Zoom also brought Sand Demon over with the same offer he made Atom-Smasher, to kill the Flash and he'd
 return him home and Sand Demon agreed. Once Sand Demon attacked Barry, Hunter offered his help to the team. However, Barry
 declined, believing they didn't need his help, and Hunter was locked back up in the pipeline.
 <h4>Identity revealed</h4>
 For six weeks, Hunter waited for Cisco to open a breach. One day, Hunter felt a breach being opened. He raced to where
 this was occurring and watched as a breach was being opened, but was disappointed when Cisco abruptly stopped. When Cisco
 opened a breach once again, Zoom made his way over. Zoom told Flash they made a mistake and the two raced over to S.T.A.R.
 Labs. Hunter then noted that Flash had gotten much faster, which would give him more speed to steal. Barry and Zoom
 quickly fought but Zoom hesitated as Flash set up cutouts of his parents. With Zoom briefly distracted, Zoom was shot
 by Flash with the B.O.O.T. With Hunter subdued and unmasked, Hunter asked how Barry knew his past. Barry then told him
 he made a mistake by revealing to Caitlin who his doppelgänger was. When Hunter asked how he knew he was Zoom, Barry
 revealed he was aware that Velocity serums turn a speedster's lightning blue if they run fast enough. Hunter noted Barry
 was clever to use his family against him and that family is a weakness. Hunter then told Barry that he couldn't lock the
 darkness up before breaking out and speeding off.
 Zoom takes speed
 Hunter takes Barry's speed.
 Following Barry's move, Zoom kidnapped Wally West and brought him to his lair on Earth Two. Zoom was then contacted by
 Vibe, who told him Barry would give up his speed. Zoom made his way back to Earth One, with Wally. Once he passed Wally
 over, Hunter had Harrison Wells make preparations, the latter of which promised to knock his smug face off one day. Hunter
 then explained that the "Jay" he killed was his time remnant rather than a speed mirage, explaining that he realized he
 needed to be on both Earths once Barry closed all the breaches and went to Earth Two. Hunter also told them that he enjoys
 pretending to be a hero so he could rip hope away from everyone, though Hunter was called a monster, by Caitlin, the very
 words his father was called. Once Barry ran on the treadmill and his speed absorbed, Hunter injected the vial with Barry's
 speed and cured himself. Hunter then thanked Barry as he held him against a wall, ready to give him death in return.
 However, just as Hunter was about to deal the killing blow, Caitlin told Hunter if there was a piece of humanity left in
 him, if he really loved her, he wouldn't kill Barry. Hunter then dropped Barry before kidnapping Caitlin.
