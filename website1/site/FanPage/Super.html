	<h3> Barry Allen Story</h3>
<p> Bartholomew Henry "Barry" Allen (born c. 1989) is a scientist in the Criminal and Forensic Science Division of 
 Central City Police Department. Barry is the son of Henry Allen and Nora Allen, the foster son of Joe West, and the best 
 friend/boyfriend of Iris West. Barry's mother was murdered when he was a child and the blame was wrongfully placed on his 
 father. He was taken in by Joe West and he dedicated his life to proving his father's innocence. After the S.T.A.R. Labs
 particle accelerator exploded, it caused a giant thundercloud to form and Barry was struck by lightning,When he woke up 
 from his coma 9 months later, Barry met Dr. Wells, Cisco Ramon and Caitlin Snow. He learned of his coma and how it had 
 been caused by the explosion of the particle accelerator. Much to their annoyance, Barry chose to leave, claiming that he
 felt normal. Barry went to meet Iris at her work, where the two embraced, Iris incredibly thrilled to see Barry awake and 
 walking. As they talked, Barry noticed time slow down, then fasten back up again. Iris grabbed her jacket, then they went 
 to visit Joe at the police department. Joe was more than happy to see Barry, though he was called to a robbery at Gold City
 Bank. Detective Thawne followed West, also expressing his happiness at Barry's return. As they left, Barry noticed a rough
 detainee, who quickly reached for a police officer's gun. Before he could grab it, Barry sped over to him and back, 
 stopping him from doing anything

<div class="container"><h4>Early days and setbacks</h4>
 Barry Allen experiencing dizzy spells
 Barry continued to save citizens throughout Central City, much to the frustration of Caitlin and Joe. At his day job with 
 the CCPD, Barry investigated a strange robbery and murder scene wherein the surveillance footage showed one man, but
 evidence indicated that there were at least six present. He later made a casual remark that the perp's footprints were
 about the same size as those of Captain Singh's but was reprimanded for it by Joe, who reminded him not to tell Iris about 
 his ability. Later, Barry went to Stagg Industries with Iris, where Simon Stagg was set to receive an award from Central 
 City University. Iris was covering the event for her journalism assignment and needed Barry to help her with the
 scientific parts. At the event, the armed gunmen responsible for the scene Barry had just investigated came arrived and
 was in the process of taking their valuables when a security guard attempted to stop them. Just before they could shoot
 him, Barry saved him and went after the robbers, only to lose consciousness along the way. After his fainting, this
 prompted the S.T.A.R. Labs scientists to investigate Barry's recent weaknesses. After a run at a "Cisco'd" treadmill,
 it was discovered that Barry had acute hypoglycemia, a condition that Barry developed because of his sped-up metabolism
 and could be remedied by a more extensive meal plan. Joe then arrived at the lab and called him out for his unnecessary
 heroics. Because of this, Barry lost confidence in himself and, face to face with Danton Black, the meta-human that
 infiltrated the Stagg event, he realized that he did not have the ability to really go up against them. At this point,
 Iris was still trying to get Barry to tell her what was going on with him. Just when he had momentarily quit his
 association with Wells and the others, Iris revealed that her new journalism topic would be his alter-ego, who has been
 dubbed the "red streak" by citizens. Caitlin then called Barry back to S.T.A.R. Labs and told him of a way to defeat Black.
 Joe then arrived to convince Barry to go after him. Barry did and followed Danton to Stagg Industries, where he intended to
 kill Stagg once and for all. With pep talk from those at the Lab, including Joe, Barry was able to isolate the real Danton
 from the hundreds of clones and put him down. When Danton momentarily regained consciousness, he attacked Barry only to
 miss and hit the window. Barry tried to save him from falling but Danton, not wanting to be saved, summoned up an extra
 hand to pull him from Barry's grip and fell, much to Barry's disappointment. Later, Barry commended the group at the lab,
 who then fully supported Barry's city-saving, even Caitlin, and made amends with Joe.
<h4>Story</h4>
 Later Barry visited Iris once again as the Streak and tried to convince her to stop writing about him. However she ignored
 his request and instead tried to find out more about him. She then asked what she should call him with Barry claiming
 anything would be better than "the Streak". Their conversation was cut short when they heard sirens. Rushing to the
 crime Barry saved a kid who was about to get ran over by the culprit. Cutting the criminal off, Barry discovered he was
 a meta-human when the man rip the door off of the door of Humvee he had stolen and threw it at him. Barry dodged this
 and attacked the man, only for his skin to turn into a steel like substance which resulted in him injuring his hand and
 the man brutally back handing him. Beaten Barry escaped but not before the criminal told him that he was "born to take a
 beating" a phrase that seemed familiar to him. Rushing back to S.T.A.R Labs Barry passed out on the floor . Caitlin
 examined his injuries and told him he had various fractures, a concussion and a bruised spleen the injuries being so
 severe to the point that Caitlin told him even with his healing abilities it would take a couple hours for him to recover .
 Barry then told them about the meta-humans abilities. Barry then asked how he was gonna fight a man made of steel. Dr. Wells
 and the team assured that they would find a way. The next day Barry reported to the Central Police Department, where he
 confirmed with Joe that the metal man was indeed a meta-human. Joe told Barry that he was putting him and Eddie on the case 
 so that Barry could explain to Eddie what he saw. Barry then went to see the Central City District Attorney. The DA
 identified the "man of steel" as Tony Woodward. Barry recognized the name. Woodward was a former classmate of Barry and
 Iris’, who bullied Barry throughout his childhood. After the meeting, Barry and Eddie ran into Iris. Eddie asks Barry
 what’s going on between Iris and him, not knowing that Barry was avoiding Iris but Barry told him everything was fine.
 <h4>First battle against Zoom</h4>
 Barry asked Dr. Light for help to stop Zoom, though Light urged him not to, though she eventually agreed. Barry told
 the team of the trap while Harrison Wells told them he developed a serum that could dampen Zoom's speed. Barry and
 Joe were then called to the CCPD precinct. At the CCPD, Barry was told by Patty that Joe shut her down on a case and
 asked if it was because of their kiss, though Barry told her he never told him. After Dr. Light escaped, Barry rushed
 over to S.T.A.R. Labs but was too late. In fear of Dr. Light going after Earth-1 Linda again, Barry had Iris take
 Linda into her home. Barry and Joe then had an argument that they shouldn't go after Zoom just yet. Barry reminded
 Joe that he always said it's good to play offense rather than defense at times but Joe told him that was for football
 tryouts. At Iris' house, Barry suggested they use Linda to lure Zoom, though realizing what he was saying was wrong,
 Iris told him it was a good idea. At S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry greeted Linda. The S.T.A.R. Labs team took Linda on a practice
 run. After a few attempts, Linda eventually succeeded. When he went to hi-five Linda, the latter accidentally fired a
 blast of light to the former, though he managed to evade it. Later, Joe told Barry that Linda wasn't ready but Barry
 told him otherwise. Later that night, the Flash went to visit Linda. When Linda said she wasn't ready, the Flash told
 her she's one of the strongest woman he knew. When she asked what he based that on, he revealed his identity. The
 following day, Barry was asked by Patty if he could go out for dinner but Barry told her he had something else to take
 care of that night. At night, Barry and Linda faked a battle where the latter came victorious, though Zoom never showed.
 Later when Zoom eventually arrived and kidnapped Linda, Barry ran over. Zoom told him that he isn't the only one who
 fished with bait and proceeded to drop Linda off the roof of S.T.A.R. Labs. Barry ran down and slowed her fall down and
 caught her. Barry then ran around S.T.A.R. Labs in circles and hurled lightning at Zoom, though the latter caught the
 lightning and hurled it back at him. Barry then made an attempt a free fall fight for equal velocity though Zoom still
 came on top. Zoom proceeded to beat Barry and broke his spine. When Wells tried shooting Zoom with the speed dampening
 serum, Zoom caught it and used it against Barry. Zoom then dragged Barry to Central City Picture News and the CCPD,
 announcing their hero had been defeated. Barry was dragged back to S.T.A.R. Labs where Zoom shoved his claw like hands
 into Barry's abdomen, rendering Barry unconscious. When Barry woke up, he was told Linda left for Coast City. Barry then
 told the team he couldn't feel his legs
